  <h1><B>Welcome to the Church of Spongebob!</B></h1> 
  <P>The Church of Spongebob is a joke that should not be taken seriously ever. Most of the content on the website are references to the television show. I hope that this doesn't offend anyone in anyway, but I needed something to make this assignment fun so I don't break my keyboard after getting code wrong for an hour. </P>
